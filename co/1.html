	<p><i>COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). COVID-19 is caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. This disease was earlier referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’. India is currently experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 cases. The death toll of COVID-19 in India is the second highest in the world.</i></p></center>
